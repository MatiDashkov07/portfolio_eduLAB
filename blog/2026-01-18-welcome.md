Welcome to the eduLAB Engineering Blog! This is where I document my journey from breadboard tinkerer to professional hardware designer.

<!-- truncate -->

## What is This?

I'm an 18-year-old Israeli student building embedded systems projects and preparing for an Electrical & Computer Engineering degree at Technion. This blog is my way of "building in public" - sharing what I learn, the mistakes I make, and the breakthroughs I discover along the way.

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public means documenting the process, not just the polished results. You'll find:

- **Build logs**: Step-by-step documentation of projects
- **Debugging stories**: Real problems I encountered and how I solved them
- **Theory posts**: Deep dives into concepts I'm learning
- **Project updates**: Progress on ongoing work

The goal isn't to impress, but to learn and help others who might be on similar paths.

## What's Coming

The first major project I'll be documenting here is the **eduLAB Synthesis Engine** - a high-performance audio synthesis engine running on Teensy 4.1. Expect posts about:

- Real-time DSP programming challenges
- Mixed-signal hardware design decisions
- PCB layout considerations
- Debugging I2S audio interfaces
- And plenty of "what went wrong" stories

## Join the Journey

If you're interested in embedded systems, hardware design, or just curious about how things work, I hope you'll find something useful here. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss projects!

Let's build something together.
