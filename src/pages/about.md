# About

Hi, I'm Mati Dashkov, an 18-year-old Israeli pre-university student passionate about embedded systems and hardware design. This blog documents my journey from self-taught maker to future Electrical & Computer Engineering student at Technion.

## My Journey

I started tinkering with electronics on breadboards, learning through trial and error, datasheets, and online resources. What began as curiosity about how things work has evolved into a serious pursuit of professional hardware design. I'm building in public to share what I learn, document my mistakes, and connect with others on similar paths.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm deep into the **eduLAB Synthesis Engine** project - a high-performance audio synthesis engine running on Teensy 4.1. This project combines:

- Real-time DSP programming in C++
- Mixed-signal hardware design
- I2S audio interfaces
- PCB design and layout

It's teaching me the practical challenges of embedded systems that you can't learn from textbooks alone.

## Skills

### Proficient
- **Languages**: C/C++, Embedded Systems Programming
- **Hardware**: Oscilloscope/Logic Analyzer usage, Circuit debugging
- **Tools**: Git, Basic PCB design workflow

### Intermediate
- **PCB Design**: KiCad (schematic capture, layout basics)
- **DSP**: Basic digital signal processing concepts
- **Python**: Scripting and automation

### Learning
- **FPGA**: Verilog/VHDL basics, FPGA development workflows
- **Advanced Analog Design**: Precision circuits, noise analysis
- **Professional PCB Layout**: Impedance control, EMI considerations

## Goals & Roadmap

**Short-term (next 6 months):**
- Complete eduLAB Synthesis Engine with full documentation
- Design and fabricate a custom PCB for the project
- Write detailed build logs and debugging stories

**Medium-term (1-2 years):**
- Start Electrical & Computer Engineering degree at Technion
- Build more complex mixed-signal projects
- Contribute to open-source hardware projects

**Long-term:**
- Work on professional embedded systems
- Design hardware that solves real problems
- Continue learning and sharing knowledge
